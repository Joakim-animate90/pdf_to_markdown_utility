# PDF to Markdown Utility

This project provides a utility to convert PDF files into JPEG images and then convert those images into markdown format using OpenAI's API. It consists of several Python scripts, each serving a specific function in the conversion process.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up your `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
   ```

## Usage

### Main Script

- **`main.py`**: This is the entry point of the application. It coordinates the conversion of a PDF file into images and then processes those images into markdown format.

  - **Functions**:
    - `main()`: Calls the `pdf_to_images` function to convert the PDF into images and then calls `process_images_to_markdown` to convert those images into markdown files.

### Image Splitter

- **`image_splitter.py`**: Handles the conversion of PDF files into individual JPEG images.

  - **Functions**:
    - `pdf_to_images(pdf_path, dpi=300, output_folder="page_jpegs")`: Converts each page of a PDF into a JPEG image and saves them in the specified output folder.

### Image to Markdown Converter

- **`image_to_markdowns.py`**: Converts the images into markdown format using OpenAI's API.

  - **Functions**:
    - `encode_image_to_base64(image_path)`: Encodes an image file to a base64 string.
    - `image_to_markdown(base64_image)`: Sends a base64-encoded image to the OpenAI API to get a markdown description.
    - `process_images_to_markdown(image_folder="page_jpegs", output_folder="page_markdowns")`: Processes all images in a specified folder, converting them to markdown using the `image_to_markdown` function.

## Output

The markdown files generated by this utility are structured to closely mirror the layout and content of the original PDF pages. Here is an example of the processed markdown output from Page_1.md:

### How to Successfully Scale Generative AI in Pharma

Go beyond the “what” of experimentation to the “how” of setting an organization-wide scaling strategy.

The generative artificial intelligence (AI) transformation is well underway in pharma. And pharma companies have high confidence in its value: Already, 40% of executives say that they are baking expected savings into their 2024 budget (see Figure 1), and 60% have set targets for cost savings or productivity boosts, according to a recent Bain survey.

```

This markdown format includes headings, lists, tables, and descriptions of images or charts, making it suitable for various document processing needs.

## Notes

- Ensure your `.env` file is correctly set up with your OpenAI API key.
- The output markdown files are saved in the `page_markdowns` directory.
